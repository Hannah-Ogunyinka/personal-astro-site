subtitle1: 'The Company'
description1: "Platinum Events Planning are an award winning wedding planning company that deliver unique and memorable occasions for their clients. Although crafting an unforgettable experience can be overwhelming, Platinum Events Planning is run by a personable husband and wife couple who understand first hand the challenges that could arise:\n

Their extensive knowledge of planning events means they are best positioned to foresee possible complications and prepare for them, resulting in a stress-free, happy day.  Platinum Event Planning consistently exceeds their clients’ expectations, delivering service to a high, professional standard."
subtitle2: "The Brief"
description2: "Platinum Event Planning wanted their business to be perceived as elegant, luxurious, clean, peaceful and stress-free.  While this is the impression they made with their clients, their website needed to express the same values.\n

There were design aspects of the site that could be improved to give users a better experience and project a more professional image.
Also the business was transitioning away from offering general event coordination and wedding planning to offering wedding planning and coordination services exclusively. \n

The messaging on the website needed to clearly reflect this change and effectively communicate their wealth of experience in the field."
subtitle3: "The Strategy and \nDesign"
description3: "In order to convey elegance yet peaceful, a simple, minimalist colour palette was adopted of black, white, champagne and tones of grey. The layout incorporated a lot of white space, to express exclusivity and from a user experience perspective, allow the eye moments of rest as you moved through each page. The typeface selection also conveyed luxury and was narrowed down to a set of two – in keeping with the minimalist feel.\n

To attract a professional clientele, it was important that the site incorporated professional features. One significant area was to create a portfolio section that showcased the work Platinum Event Planning had done over the years with a look that was sleek yet with content that was easy to digest. This area had to be easy to update as their client portfolio expanded.\n 

The solution for this was to design a page template so that each case study adopted the same look and feel but only required inputting entries into a form to create. An easily updatable custom template was also created for the PEP Lounge ( a term coined by Baya Garden studio) which in contrast to the portfolio area, has a more relaxed, behind the scenes feel.\n

The entire website was built with”blocks”, which is a more native solution to WordPress that produces clean code and excellent performance.
Regular Call to Action opportunities were positioned across the site to optimise for conversion, resulting in a performant, conversion optimised and custom designed site."
